I created this repo while travelling in india.

C is a procedural programming lang..Main features of c
1) Low level access to memory
2) Simple set of keywords
3) clean style

Best suited for system programming (like os dev or compiler dev)...very useful for some addons with node

Aim of this repo is to quickly refresh c concepts by doing some excercises from old Dennis Richie Book (K & R)

** Use gcc to compile the programs...Look at the comments inside the program to understand better **


========================================== HOW TO COMPILE USING GCC =============================================================================================================

gcc -Wall <fileName.c> -o <output>

-o is used to specify the output file name (else a.out is generated on unix based os)
-Wall would enable all compiler warnings with messages. Recommended for better code
